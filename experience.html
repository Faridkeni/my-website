        <b>Working</b><br />
            During last year’s semester break, I had filled that vacation with working. I wanted to find work for experience even if the time was short. At the same time, I also want to help my family and want find money to survive at college when the new semester begins. There are several places I work, which are fastfood restaurant and storekeeper at mall. I am very comfortable and happy to be able to earn my own money without expecting my parents ’money.

        <b>Co-curriculum</b><br />
        During kid, I have been very interested in playing football since I was a child. Because of that, I took a chance by playing football while in primary school. I often practice at home in order to hone this talent. At the secondry school, I have represented the school in football events at the school level. This was the most memorable experience while in secondry school back then.<br>
        This is my favourite player; Cristiano Ronaldo:p
